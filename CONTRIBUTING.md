# Contributing Guidelines

**Do** follow [the seven rules of a great Git commit message][1].

**Do** follow [git best practices][2] wherever possible.

**Do** squash the commits in your PR to remove corrections
irrelevant to the code history.

**Do** feel free to pester the project maintainers about the PR if it
hasn't been responded to. Sometimes notifications can be missed.

**Don't** overuse vertical whitespace; avoid multiple sequential blank
lines.

**Don't** include more than one feature or fix in a single PR.

**Don't** include changes unrelated to the purpose of the PR. This
includes changing the project version number, adding lines to the
`.gitignore` file, or changing the indentation or formatting.

**Don't** open a new PR if changes are requested. Just push to the
same branch and the PR will be updated.
