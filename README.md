- 18/05/2020 - Esrin - A very hacky method has been introduced to allow the built in FoundryVTT combat tracker to roll initiative using FFG dice results. The resulting number is made up of successes and advantages. For example 1 success and 2 advantage would result in 1.02 for the initiative tracker. Warning, there might be bugs with this solution! Initiative can be switched between Vigilance and Cool via the System Settings section of the world configuration.
