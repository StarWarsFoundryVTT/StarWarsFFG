# StarWarsFFG

This is an implementation of the [Fantasy Flight Games Star Wars](https://www.fantasyflightgames.com/en/starwarsrpg/) roleplaying system by in [Foundry Virtual Tabletop](https://foundryvtt.com/).

# Requirements

This Requires the "Special Dice Roller" Module to Roll the dice and calculate the results. 
This is most easily available from the in-game Module browser. After installing it you will need to activate it on your world.
