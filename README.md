# To-do

NEEDED FOR RELEASE V1:

- Group Management sheet for GM use (currently in progress).
- Create equipable item functionality and rework inventory to suit. Continue to improve inventory display in the process.
- Add Forcepower item type (based on talent).
- Add Maximum Altitude and Crew Capacity to vehicle sheet.
- Redo the dice selection popup to be more functional and provide upgrade ability and upgrade difficulty buttons.
- Rebuild dice functionality to use Foundry Dice instead of chat content, remove requirement for Special-Dice-Roller.
- Look into drag-and-drop item behaviours for things like transferring items between characters, or into a vehicle cargo hold.

NICE TO HAVE:

- Create JS data models for species, careers and specialisations and use those in prepareData to define career skills and starting characteristics.
- Attempt to fix display of wound and strain bars so that they suit FFG system.
- Genesys cross-compatibility (dice, sheets).
- Rework Special Qualities and Critical Injuries to be item type, add view to item sheets and character sheets.
- Character creator.
